This is a car park simulator for my school which has many functionalities including (but not limited to) toggle filters, order by field, record selection, add data.
I have included sql queries with fake data generated by agentic artificial intelligence that you can easily run on an sql server for testing data.

Dependencies:
-I used SQL server for my program so i think it is necessary to use one aswell or it will run into conflicts with database connections

Libraries used:
-flask
-pyodbc
-datetime
-bootstrap for css
